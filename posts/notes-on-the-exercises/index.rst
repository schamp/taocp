1. [00] What does the rating "M20" mean?
   
   The rating "M20" means the exercise is mathematically oriented and has an average difficulty that would take 15 to 20 minutes to answer completely.

2. [10] Of what value can the exercises in a textbook be to the reader?
   
   The exercises can ensure that a student understands the material and the background necessary for it, and can demonstrate that understanding.  For self-study, demonstration can both reinforce and prove that learning has taken place.

3. [14] Prove that :math:`13^3 = 2197`.  Generalize your answer.

   :math:`13^3 = 13*13*13 = 169*13 = 2197`

   I'm not entirely sure how to generalize that...

4. [HM45] Prove that when :math:`n` is an integer, :math:`n > 2`, the equation :math:`x^n + y^n = z^n` has no solution in positive integers :math:`x, y, z`
